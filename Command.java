/**
 *  This class is a class of the "Shipwreck Adventure" application. 
 *  "Shipwreck Adventure" is a very simple, text based adventure game.  
 *
 * This class holds information about a command that was issued by the user.
 * A command currently consists of three strings: a command word, a second
 * word, a third word (for example, if the command was "take map", then the two strings
 * obviously are "take" and "map", or "give oyster fish" the three string are "give", "oyster" and "fish").
 * 
 * The way this is used is: Commands are already checked for being valid
 * command words. If the user entered an invalid command (a word that is not
 * known) then the command word is <null>.
 *
 * If the command had only one word, then the second word is <null>.
 * If the command had two words, then the third word is <null>.
